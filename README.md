# 20 Hints

Inspired by one of my favorite board games, this engaging game invites players to decipher secret words from vague clues within a limited time. Players can choose from a diverse dictionary of words organized into various categories before the game begins.

The game is built using React Native alongside traditional web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript. The word dictionary was pre-generated using the Llama 3.2 language model.

## Future Enhancements:

- Implementing automated dictionary generation within the app
- Introducing a story mode for an enriched gaming experience
